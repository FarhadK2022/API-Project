# About Don'tBnB
Don'tBnB is a website clone, taking inspiration from AirBnB. Don'tBnB is a site that can be used for finding accomodations all over the world. Users can host their own place, be in search of a location to host their next adventure, or simply find someplace for a change of scenery. This is a great tool for families, couples, lone wolves, big groups.

I have truly enjoyed building this app from the ground up, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as well. For your viewing pleasure, you can test features without signing in by selecting the 'Demo User' button from the drop-down menu in the top-right corner.
